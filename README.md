# 👋 Hi, I am Daniel Baesso!

🎯 **Data Analyst | Data Scientist | Geospatial Intelligence | Python Enthusiast**

I'm passionate about **turning data into insights, decisions, and impact** that help people, communities, and organizations make smarter decisions.

> <i>`“Good data analysis doesn’t just describe reality — it helps improve it.”`</i>

With a background in **Geography and Demography**, I combine **data science, geospatial analysis**, and **public statistics** to solve real-world problems — from logistics optimization to environmental and social diagnostics.

I believe in combining **scientific thinking**, **ethical responsibility**, and **technical precision**.

> <i>`“Data is not just numbers — it’s the story of people, places, and possibilities.”`</i>

Every dataset tells a story — my mission is to help that story lead to **better decisions** and **more sustainable futures**.
